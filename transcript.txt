 hello everyone welcome to the next  lecture in theory of computation and in  this lecture we will be studying about  finite State machines all right so let's  get started so finite State machines it  is also known as finite automata and  this finite automata is divided into two  broad categories the first one being  finite automata with output and the  second one being finite automata without  output and finite automata with output  we again have two categories namely  murri machine and mil machine and in  finite automata without output we have  three categories namely deterministic  finite automata or DFA non deterministic  finite automata or NFA and Epsilon  non-deterministic finite automata or  Epsilon NFA all right so in this lecture  we will be mainly focusing and studying  about our deterministic finite automata  or  DFA okay so DFA it stands for  deterministic finite automata before we  start off with DFA let us remember two  important properties of finite State  machines that we should always remember  and they are finite State machines it is  the simplest model of computation and  also finite State machines has a very  limited memory so these are two  important points that we should always  keep in mind before we study anything  related to finite State machines okay  now we can start off with deterministic  finite automata or DFA now to make DFA  clear let us take a simple diagram that  will make the structure of DFA clear to  us so this diagram here it shows us the  structure of a deterministic finite  automata or  DFA so first when you look at this  diagram you may feel confused what are  these what do we see here we see some  circles labeled as a b c d we see some  edges some arrows pointing here and  there and we have seen some labelings  like 1 1 0 011 and what are all these  okay so I will explain to you what this  means so that the structure of this DFA  becomes clear to us so first of all the  first thing that we need to know are  states these  circles represented by a b c and d these  circles are known as States okay A B C D  are states and then we see some edges  see one Edge goes from A to B another  Edge goes from B to a and here also we  see an edge going from a to c and  another from C to a and here we see one  going from C to D and from D to C B to d  d to B so what are these these edges are  actually the transitions so what does  this mean this transition means that  suppose we are in state a and this Edge  labeled with one this labeling of edges  are known as inputs these are our inputs  so it what it means is that when I am in  state a and if I get input one if the  input I get is one so my state a goes  from A to B all right and in the same  way if I am in state a and if I get  input zero then what happens State a  goes from a to  c okay and let's take one more example  suppose I'm in state C and I get input  one so where do I go I go from C to D  and in D if I get input say zero it goes  from D to B so that is how the  transition occurs so this labelings of  the edges they are our inputs and the  circles are our states so it shows how  the states transits from one state to  another on getting certain inputs okay  so th that was about the states and the  inputs now we see that there is  something different about State a and  state D so what are they in state a we  see an arrow that is coming from nowhere  and pointing to a so what is this this  means that that a is the starting State  or the initial state of this DFA  whenever you see an arrow coming from  nowhere pointing to a state that shows  that that is the initial State or the  starting  State and if you look at State D there  is something different what is that  every other states have one Circle but  this state D has two circles it has a  double circle around it and what does  that mean whenever you see a double  circle it means that that is the final  State or the terminating state so this  state D represented by two circles it is  the final state of this  DFA all right so those were the main  things that you need to know about a DFA  so that makes the structure of DFA clear  to  us okay so now let us write down the  formal definition of this DFA so every  DFA can be defined using five tles which  are Q  Sigma  Q F and Del every DFA can be defined  using these five tles now let us see  what are these Tes what do they mean  first of all we have q q is  the set  of  all states the set of all states is  known as q and what is Sigma Sigma is  the inputs our inputs is represented by  Sigma and then the next one is Q not  what is Q not Q not is  the uh start  State the start  state or it's also known as the initial  state is a  initial State okay and then the next one  is f f is  a set  of final States  the set of final States is known as F so  here in this example we had only one  final state but we could even have more  than one final states that is why I have  written set of final States all right  and the last one is Dell so what is Dell  Dell is  a transition  function it is a transition  function that  Maps Okay from  Q cross Sigma to Q it is a transition  function that Maps Q cross Sigma to Q  don't worry even if you don't understand  this this will become clear when I take  the example I will be showing you in the  example okay so now let us try to write  down what are the values for these five  tles for this example that we have taken  here for our particular DFA what are the  values for  this Tes first of all we have q Q so  what is Q  here Q is a set of all states so what  are the set of all states a b c and  d a b c and d this is our q and what is  our Sigma Sigma is the inputs what are  our inputs we have inputs here zero and  one zeros and ones are the inputs we use  here so it is 0 and one okay so that is  uh Sigma and what is the next one Q not  Q not is the start State or the initial  state so I already told you whenever we  see an arrow coming from nowhere  pointing to a state that is the start  state so our start State here is  a a okay and then the next one is f f is  the set of final States so what is the  final State here D we have only one  final State whenever you see a double  circle that represents a final state so  I should probably put it in the bracket  because it could be more than one but in  this example it is only one so set of  set of final States is D and then the  last  one Dell Dell is a transition function  from Q cross Sigma to Q now to  demonstrate this let me take a table  over here I'll use this table to explain  what  is uh Del so for  that uh let me have this table where  this top part will be my input 01 and  I'll have my States in this part A B C  and D all right now let's see what is  this what does this mean so suppose I am  in state a and I get input zero so what  happens when I'm in state a and I get  input zero it goes to State C right a to  c I'm in state a if I get input zero I  come to State C all right and if I'm in  state a and if I get input one what do  it Happ what happens it goes to State B  see over here when we there is input one  it goes to State  b b now let's come to state number B in  B when I get input zero where does it go  it goes to State  D and when I get input one where does it  go from B if I get input one it goes to  a all right now I'm in state C suppose  I'm in state C and if I get input zero  where does it go it goes to State  a state a and if I in state C and get  input one if I'm in state C and get  input one it goes to  State D all right and if I'm in state D  and I get input zero where does it go it  goes to State  B and in from State D if I get input one  it goes to State  C so this is the transition function d  it maps from Q cross Sigma to Q so that  is how we write the transition function  for the DFA so this was the basic  structure of a DFA I hope you UND  understood it so these are the main  things that you should remember and this  is the structure of the DFA and we will  take some examples in the following  lectures which will make it more clear  to us so thank you for watching see you  in the next lecture  [Music]
