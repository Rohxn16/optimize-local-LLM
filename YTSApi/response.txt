hello everyone welcome to the nextlecture in theory of computation and inthis lecture we will be studying aboutfinite State machines all right so let'sget started so finite State machines itis also known as finite automata andthis finite automata is divided into twobroad categories the first one beingfinite automata with output and thesecond one being finite automata withoutoutput and finite automata with outputwe again have two categories namelymurri machine and mil machine and infinite automata without output we havethree categories namely deterministicfinite automata or DFA non deterministicfinite automata or NFA and Epsilonnon-deterministic finite automata orEpsilon NFA all right so in this lecturewe will be mainly focusing and studyingabout our deterministic finite automataorDFA okay so DFA it stands fordeterministic finite automata before westart off with DFA let us remember twoimportant properties of finite Statemachines that we should always rememberand they are finite State machines it isthe simplest model of computation andalso finite State machines has a verylimited memory so these are twoimportant points that we should alwayskeep in mind before we study anythingrelated to finite State machines okaynow we can start off with deterministicfinite automata or DFA now to make DFAclear let us take a simple diagram thatwill make the structure of DFA clear tous so this diagram here it shows us thestructure of a deterministic finiteautomata orDFA so first when you look at thisdiagram you may feel confused what arethese what do we see here we see somecircles labeled as a b c d we see someedges some arrows pointing here andthere and we have seen some labelingslike 1 1 0 011 and what are all theseokay so I will explain to you what thismeans so that the structure of this DFAbecomes clear to us so first of all thefirst thing that we need to know arestates thesecircles represented by a b c and d thesecircles are known as States okay A B C Dare states and then we see some edgessee one Edge goes from A to B anotherEdge goes from B to a and here also wesee an edge going from a to c andanother from C to a and here we see onegoing from C to D and from D to C B to dd to B so what are these these edges areactually the transitions so what doesthis mean this transition means thatsuppose we are in state a and this Edgelabeled with one this labeling of edgesare known as inputs these are our inputsso it what it means is that when I am instate a and if I get input one if theinput I get is one so my state a goesfrom A to B all right and in the sameway if I am in state a and if I getinput zero then what happens State agoes from a toc okay and let's take one more examplesuppose I'm in state C and I get inputone so where do I go I go from C to Dand in D if I get input say zero it goesfrom D to B so that is how thetransition occurs so this labelings ofthe edges they are our inputs and thecircles are our states so it shows howthe states transits from one state toanother on getting certain inputs okayso th that was about the states and theinputs now we see that there issomething different about State a andstate D so what are they in state a wesee an arrow that is coming from nowhereand pointing to a so what is this thismeans that that a is the starting Stateor the initial state of this DFAwhenever you see an arrow coming fromnowhere pointing to a state that showsthat that is the initial State or thestartingState and if you look at State D thereis something different what is thatevery other states have one Circle butthis state D has two circles it has adouble circle around it and what doesthat mean whenever you see a doublecircle it means that that is the finalState or the terminating state so thisstate D represented by two circles it isthe final state of thisDFA all right so those were the mainthings that you need to know about a DFAso that makes the structure of DFA cleartous okay so now let us write down theformal definition of this DFA so everyDFA can be defined using five tles whichare QSigmaQ F and Del every DFA can be definedusing these five tles now let us seewhat are these Tes what do they meanfirst of all we have q q isthe setofall states the set of all states isknown as q and what is Sigma Sigma isthe inputs our inputs is represented bySigma and then the next one is Q notwhat is Q not Q not isthe uh startState the startstate or it's also known as the initialstate is ainitial State okay and then the next oneis f f isa setof final Statesthe set of final States is known as F sohere in this example we had only onefinal state but we could even have morethan one final states that is why I havewritten set of final States all rightand the last one is Dell so what is DellDell isa transitionfunction it is a transitionfunction thatMaps Okay fromQ cross Sigma to Q it is a transitionfunction that Maps Q cross Sigma to Qdon't worry even if you don't understandthis this will become clear when I takethe example I will be showing you in theexample okay so now let us try to writedown what are the values for these fivetles for this example that we have takenhere for our particular DFA what are thevalues forthis Tes first of all we have q Q sowhat is Qhere Q is a set of all states so whatare the set of all states a b c andd a b c and d this is our q and what isour Sigma Sigma is the inputs what areour inputs we have inputs here zero andone zeros and ones are the inputs we usehere so it is 0 and one okay so that isuh Sigma and what is the next one Q notQ not is the start State or the initialstate so I already told you whenever wesee an arrow coming from nowherepointing to a state that is the startstate so our start State here isa a okay and then the next one is f f isthe set of final States so what is thefinal State here D we have only onefinal State whenever you see a doublecircle that represents a final state soI should probably put it in the bracketbecause it could be more than one but inthis example it is only one so set ofset of final States is D and then thelastone Dell Dell is a transition functionfrom Q cross Sigma to Q now todemonstrate this let me take a tableover here I'll use this table to explainwhatis uh Del so forthat uh let me have this table wherethis top part will be my input 01 andI'll have my States in this part A B Cand D all right now let's see what isthis what does this mean so suppose I amin state a and I get input zero so whathappens when I'm in state a and I getinput zero it goes to State C right a toc I'm in state a if I get input zero Icome to State C all right and if I'm instate a and if I get input one what doit Happ what happens it goes to State Bsee over here when we there is input oneit goes to Stateb b now let's come to state number B inB when I get input zero where does it goit goes to StateD and when I get input one where does itgo from B if I get input one it goes toa all right now I'm in state C supposeI'm in state C and if I get input zerowhere does it go it goes to Statea state a and if I in state C and getinput one if I'm in state C and getinput one it goes toState D all right and if I'm in state Dand I get input zero where does it go itgoes to StateB and in from State D if I get input oneit goes to StateC so this is the transition function dit maps from Q cross Sigma to Q so thatis how we write the transition functionfor the DFA so this was the basicstructure of a DFA I hope you UNDunderstood it so these are the mainthings that you should remember and thisis the structure of the DFA and we willtake some examples in the followinglectures which will make it more clearto us so thank you for watching see youin the next lecture[Music]
